# Image Stylization based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network

Our project will take PyTorch as the core framework and use Python language to write relevant programs. Using the method of transfer learning, the pre-trained VGG-16 network is directly transferred to our program. The style and content of the image are separated by using the characteristics of retaining 
semantic information at the high level and learning texture and other simple information at the bottom of the CNN network, and the input style image and 
content image are reorganized to form a stylized image. Finally, We will try to use QT to design GUI to enhance usability and to build a user-friendly 
system that can accurately and quickly meet individual personalized needs.
